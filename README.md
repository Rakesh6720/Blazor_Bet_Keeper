# Blazor_Bet_Keeper
A demo .NET 5 Blazor Web Assembly app that tracks NFL bets.

Blazor Web Assembly is a front-end framework created and maintained by Microsoft.  Like other front-end frameworks such as React, Blazor Web Assembly uses components to render a virtual dom in a client's browser.  Unlike React, however, Blazor Web Assembly uses Microsoft's Razor syntax to blend HTML, CSS, and C#.  Blazor applications such as this compile into web assembly run in the browser through a process called JavaScript Interop.
